# BBCR1-logger
This script allows to keep a log of the tracks played on BBC Radio 1 (UK),  
the reason behind this is to have a list of the most played tracks and include them in future in a Spotify playlist that will get updated every time with the hits of the moment.

## Why?
Because BBCR1 has the best tunes IMHO, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my days shazaming every single track :)
